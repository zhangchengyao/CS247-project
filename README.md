## Keyword Extract in CQA networks
In CQA websites (Community-based Question Answering), such as Stack Overflow, precisely extracting the labels or tags for a new problem can help categorize it in a proper way. For example, one question on Stack Overflow that asked “how to turn on the syntax highlight in Vim” was tagged with “Vim” and “Highlight”. Its twin question for turning off the highlight only has tag “Vim”. Therefore, augmenting the second question with a tag “highlight” will better describe its content. So in this project, you will be asked to propose an algorithm that can accurately and efficiently extract all the tags for a new question.
